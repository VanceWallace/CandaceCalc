Sound files placeholder:

button-tap.mp3 - Button click sound effect
printer.mp3 - Thermal printer sound effect

These are placeholder files. You can replace them with actual MP3 files from:
- Freesound.org
- Zapsplat.com
- or create your own using audio editing software

For testing purposes, the app will work fine even if these are missing,
and the audio playback will gracefully fail.
